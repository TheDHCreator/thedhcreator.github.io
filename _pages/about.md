title: About Me

Samuel M. Reynolds was born in Mesa, Arizona in December of 1998. He lived in the nearby Chandler during his younger years. After graduating from Heritage Academy in 2017, Samuel served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the lower suburbs of Seattle, Washington until the Spring of 2019.

Since then, he has been pursuing his Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in Computer Science from Brigham Young University. In May of 2021, Samuel married his sweet bride, Mikayla, in the Gilbert Arizona Temple. They now live in Provo, Utah. Samuel has been an author since age 15.

When he is not writing new stories, Samuel loves to play the piano, trombone, some guitar, and sing. He also enjoys tackle football, frisbee golf, bowling, and ballroom dance. He cannot seem to get enough of any new Marvel or Star Wars release on Disney+.

Samuel dreamt of writing books since the summer of 2010. In November of 2014, he won the NaNoWriMo contest and published his first book with CreateSpace one month later, titled _Dino-Hunters Part One_. Five months later, in May of 2015, he released the sequel, _Dino-Hunters Part Two: Armageddon_. In May of 2017, he announced his third novel, _The Best Six Years: Lessons Learned from a Heritage Academy Scholar_, a personal memoir he dedicated to the wonderful memories of attending Heritage Academy in Mesa from 2011-2017.

Before leaving on his mission in the summer of 2017, Samuel assembled and unveiled _Dino-Hunters: Ultimate Edition_, a combination of Parts One and Two of the franchise and a special inclusion of the first few of the chapters of the third installment, teasing what was to come. Upon returning home from his mission, he assembled his weekly writings into his fifth book, _Vineyard Among the Evergreens: How Serving the Lord in Washington Changed My Life_, in April of 2020.

His sixth book (and final chapter of "The Long Lost Secrets" Series) is still currently in production. A release date for _Dino-Hunters Part Three: Deadlock_ is coming soon. He is also currently co-authoring a religious book with his friend, Abby Tucker.
