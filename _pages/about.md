Samuel Reynolds was born in Mesa, Arizona in December of 1998. He grew up in the nearby city of Chandler with his parents, younger brother and two younger sisters.

After graduating from Heritage Academy in 2017, Samuel served in the Washington Federal Way and Washington Seattle Missions. Upon his return home, he entered the Electrical Engineering Program at Brigham Young University in the Fall of 2019. He is now 22 years old, has completed two years of the program, and has since added two minors to his academic repertoire: Computer Science and Mathematics.

Samuel is engaged to be married and sealed to his sweetheart, Mikayla, at the end of May 2021. Mikayla is deaf and is also a cancer survivor.

In his free time, Samuel continues to further his career as an author. He published his first book on Amazon at age 15 titled "Dino-Hunters Part One" in December 2014. Five months later, he released the sequel, "Dino-Hunters Part Two: Armageddon" to the world. Samuel has written five books in total, with two final novels anticipated to arrive before the end of 2021: one will be the final installment of the "Dino-Hunters" series; the other will be a book he is co-writing with his friend, Abby and with the help of BYU Professor and Second Counselor of the General Young Men's Presidency of the Church, Brad Wilcox.

Some of Samuel's other hobbies and interests include playing piano, ballroom dancing, obsessing over the latest Disney+ Marvel or Star Wars release, sleeping, and eating.
