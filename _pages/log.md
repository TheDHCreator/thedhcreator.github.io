### Week 1: April 26th, 2021

* **Monday**: Got computer set up and went through all the Linux tutorials.
* **Tuesday**: Set up VS Code and my Github website, did pushes about what I learned and did yesterday and today, and also installed Vivado.
* **Wednesday**: Had to reinstall and update Vivado onto my Linux machine. I also cloned the Ice Machine repository, went to Dr. Hawkins' Presentation, my Broader impact meeting, Bootcamp meeting and began the Git tutorials.
* **Thursday**: Worked from home today and tried setting up VS Code access on my PC, did more Git tutorials and installed Vitis/Vivado on my PC.
* **Friday**: Tried working on more errors initalizing Ice Machine, finished the Git/GitHub tutorials, and sent name and photo as a pull request to the CCL Website. After working with Jarom to get our Ice Machine make install to build successfully, we achieved that goal and ended the week on a high note! At home in the evening, I finally was able to connect to VS Code through my IP address, was able to connect to my Lab Machine (it no longer idles), and I read a little bit ahead on modules for Monday.

### Week 2: May 3rd, 2021

* **Monday**: Installed Vivado 2019.2 and 2017.2, went to Bootcamp meeting, and did more testing to get Ice Machine (now renamed to just BFASST) to work with some basic Verilog designs. We are still running into a few bugs with the Bistream Reversal tool not working properly. I finished out the day making a basic C/C++ program and going through them running in VS Code. I also began reading the modules for Make and CMake.
* **Tuesday**: Worked from home today. Had to reinstall Vivado 2020.2 again onto my PC. Spent the day working more with Prof. Goeders and Jarom on BFASST and FASM errors and finished reading through Make and CMake modules.
* **Wednesday**: Attended Bootcamp meeting and worked with Jarom on fixing errors in xray.py to hopefully have our first tests run 100%. I also learned about stdout and stderr and Python subprocess modules. We finished out the day changing the config.py file, I fixed some issues with my CAEDM SSH Keys, and Jarom and I got the add4 module to work and be equivalent after running through all the tools! Woo hoo!
* **Thursday**: Worked from home again today. I tested all the basic designs in BFASST and all equivalence checked out except for two designs: one being not equivalent because of a bug and the other producing an error. These errors are likely from bugs in the Fasm2Bels tool we're using. I finished the day working on the Make follow up activity.
* **Friday**: Attended Bootcamp meeting and made a new yosys_compare branch on the BFASST repo because the Xilinx branch was removed. I also started learning about the Yosys Synthesis Tool, did the CMake follow up activities, and got the first use of Yosys almost working.

### Week 3: May 10th, 2021
